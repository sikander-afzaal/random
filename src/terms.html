      IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS OF USE. PLEASE
      READ THEM CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY RIBBON LABS,

      (THE "SITE") OR THE MOBILE VERSIONS OF THE RIBBON APPLICATION
      (COLLECTIVELY WITH THE SITE, THE "SERVICE"). THESE TERMS OF USE GOVERN THE
      RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND RIBBON, AND CONSTITUTE A LEGALLY BINDING
      AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND RIBBON, RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. IF
      YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE, PLEASE DO NOT REGISTER WITH RIBBON
      OR USE ANY RIBBON SERVICE.
    </p>
    <p>1. <u>Acceptance of Terms.</u></p>
    <p>
      By registering for or using the Service (or both), including, but not
      limited to, visiting or browsing the Site or contributing content to the
      Site, you agree to all of the terms and conditions in this agreement (the
      "Terms of Use"), which includes the following, all of which are hereby
      incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use: (i) the Privacy Policy;
      (ii) the Infringement Policy; (iii) any other agreement or additional
      terms and conditions accessible by a link from these Terms of Use; (iv)
      any other agreement or additional terms and conditions accessible
      elsewhere through the Service in connection with particular products or
      services offered by Ribbon; and (v) all other rules, policies and
      procedures that Ribbon may publish from time to time on the Service or
      otherwise provide you notice of. Ribbon may change or update the Terms of
      Use at any time in accordance with Section 2 below.
    </p>
    <p>2. <u>Changes to Terms of Use.</u></p>
    <p>
      Ribbon may modify these Terms of Use from time to time in its sole
      discretion by posting a notice on the Site or emailing you or both. Ribbon
      will indicate at the top of this page the date that revisions were last
      made. You should revisit these Terms of Use on a regular basis as revised
      versions will be binding on you. Any modification to these Terms of Use
      will be effective upon Ribbon's posting of the new Terms of Use. If any
      dispute arises between you and Ribbon, notwithstanding any subsequent
      modification to these Terms of Use by Ribbon, the version of these Terms
      of Use in place at the time the dispute arises shall govern and control
      the conduct of the parties. You agree and acknowledge that your continued
      use of the Service after any posted modification to the Terms of Use
      indicates your acceptance of the modification.
    </p>
    <p>3. <u>Your Access to the Service; Eligibility.</u></p>
    <p>
      You are not required to register with Ribbon in order to browse the Site,
      but you are required to register in order to use certain parts of the
      Service. You agree that your use of the Service shall at all times be in
      compliance with these Terms of Use and all applicable laws. Though Ribbon
      will use reasonable efforts to keep the Service up and running, you
      acknowledge that there may be interruptions in the Service and that the
      Service may be unavailable to you from time to time for any reason
      including routine maintenance. Ribbon retains the right to deny service,
      or access to the Service, to any person or entity or an account, at any
      time and for any reason in its sole discretion. In addition, Ribbon
      reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary in its sole
      discretion with respect to any aspect of the Service to: (i) satisfy any
      applicable law, rule, regulation, legal process or governmental request;
      (ii) enforce these Terms of Use, including without limitation,
      investigating any potential violations of these Terms of Use; (iii)
      detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
      (iv) respond to support or other requests from users; or (v) protect the
      rights, property or safety of Ribbon, its users and the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ribbon may at any time and for any reason change its eligibility criteria
      for use of the Service. All users must be 13 years of age to access the
      Service, except that those under 13 years of age may access the Service
      with parental consent and supervision. While Ribbon has certain
      protections in place to prevent those under 13 from accessing the Service,
      Ribbon realizes that this will not prevent all access. Therefore, parents
      should monitor any child's use of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with Section 17 below, you are only entitled to use the
      Service in any jurisdiction that would give effect to Section 17 below.

    </p>
    <p>
      a. Claim of Trademark or Copyright Infringement. It is Ribbon's policy to
      respect the intellectual property rights of others. Ribbon will not
      knowingly post, or allow users to post, content of any kind on the Service
      that infringes the copyright rights or other intellectual property rights
      of others. To report a claim of trademark or copyright infringement,

      information in items (i) through (vii) below to Ribbon's designated agent
      to receive claims of copyright or trademark infringement ("Designated IP
      Agent"). If Ribbon receives a written statement setting forth all of such
      information it will review the statement and take whatever action, in its
      sole discretion, it determines is appropriate, including without
      limitation, temporary or permanent removal from Ribbon's product offerings
      of the infringing mark or copyright. Your statement should include all of
      the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) Provide: (a) a list of each trademark or copyrighted work at issue;
      (b) if applicable, the country in which each trademark listed is
      registered; and (c) if applicable, the registration number of each
      trademark at issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) Identification of the material that you claim infringes the trademark
      or copyright, as well as information regarding the location of the
      allegedly infringing materials (e.g., the URL for the web page on which
      the content appears).
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) A statement that you have a good faith belief that allegedly
      infringing material is not authorized to be used by other than the
      trademark or copyright owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      (iv) A statement representing that: (a) the trademark or copyright owner
      has done an investigation of the infringement, but has not been able to
      locate the alleged infringer; or (b) the trademark or copyright owner has
      contacted the alleged infringer who has refused to comply with the
      trademark owner's requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      (v) The following statement: "I represent that the information in this
      statement is true and correct and that I am the owner of the trademark or
      copyright or authorized to act on behalf of the trademark or copyright
      owner."
    </p>
    <p>
      (vi) Your contact information including your address, telephone number and
      e-mail address. If you are not the owner of the trademark or copyright
      that has been allegedly infringed, please describe your relationship to
      the trademark or copyright owner.
    </p>
    <p>(vii) Your physical or electronic signature.</p>
    <p>
      b.
      <u>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated IP Agent.</u> If
      you are a content provider or user whose material was removed from
      Ribbon's product offerings or to which access has been disabled from
      Ribbon's product offerings, and you believe that the material that was
      removed or to which access has been disabled is not infringing, or that
      you have the right to post and use such material, in order to have your
      material reinstated or access to your material reopened, you must first
      send a counter-notice containing the following information to the
      Designated IP Agent:
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
      access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared
      before it was removed or disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) A statement that the content provider or user has a good faith belief
      that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a
      misidentification of the material.
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) Your contact information including your address, telephone number
      and e-mail address.
    </p>
    <p>
      (iv) A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court
      for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your
      address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in
      which Ribbon is located, and that you will accept service of process from
      the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
    </p>
    <p>(v) Your physical or electronic signature.</p>
    <p>
      Ribbon will respond to all counter-notices and comply with applicable law.
      Ribbon may, in its sole discretion, send a copy of any counter-notice
      received by its Designated IP Agent to the original complaining party
      informing that party that it may replace the removed material or cease
      disabling it in fifteen (15) days. Unless the trademark or copyright owner
      files an action seeking a court order against the content provider or user
      within the fifteen (15) day period and provides Ribbon with evidence of
      the filing, Ribbon may replace or restore access to the material in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>Please send all notices and counter-notices to:</p>
