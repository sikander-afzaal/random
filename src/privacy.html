    <p>Ribbon Labs, Inc. Privacy Policy</p>
    <p>Last updated December 18, 2014.</p>
    <p>
      Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Should you have any
      questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us. Our
      contact information is in Section 12 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, storage,
      use, deletion and disclosure of your personally identifiable information
      (we use this term to mean your name, email address, birthday, profile
      picture and phone number) ("Personal Information") and other information
      and data about you in connection with your use of our websites, emails,
      and mobile applications (the "Service"). The terms "we", "us", "our", and
      "Ribbon" refer to Ribbon Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation. When you use
      the Service, you consent to our collection, storage, use, deletion and
      disclosure of Personal Information and other information as described in
      this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>1. <u>Information You Provide to Us When Signing Up</u></p>
    <p>
      You may create a Ribbon account through Facebook or without using your
      Facebook account. When creating a Ribbon account through Facebook, the
      types of information we collect and store include your name, email
      address, profile images, birthday, gender, current city, home city, likes
      and interests, as well as your Facebook friend network and the current
      city and home city locations of those friends. When creating a Ribbon
      account without using your Facebook account, we collect your name, email
      address, phone number and a password. We use the term "User Basic
      Information" to describe the information you provide us about yourself at
      the time of sign up, whether or not through Facebook, and we use the term
      "User Friend Information" to describe the information you provide us about
      your friends at the time of sign up, whether or not through Facebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use much of the User Basic Information to create your basic user
      profile and to communicate with you, mostly through email, and also to
      provide information to certain third parties as described in Section 7 of
      this Privacy Policy. We use your likes and interests collected from your
      Facebook account to improve your Ribbon experience by customizing the
      content and advertising seen by you while using the Service, communicating
      with you regarding information, content or features of the Service that
      are relevant to your interests or likes, or communicating with you to
      inform you of entertainment or commercial opportunities which may be of
      interest to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the User Friend Information to help create the Ribbon network that
      allows you to interact with other users of the Service and people who are
      not yet users of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we may use any of the User Basic Information or User Friend
      Information to provide customer support, back up our systems, allow for
      disaster recovery, and comply with certain legal obligations.
    </p>
    <p>2. <u>Creating Your Ribbon Friend Network</u></p>
    <p>
      When you join Ribbon, whether through Facebook or without using your
      Facebook account, you will create your Ribbon friend network by sending
      invitations to and accepting invitations from Facebook friends who may or
      may not be Ribbon users, other Ribbon users, your phone contacts (if
      imported), or by email. Please see Section 6 below for a summary of the
      information that may be viewed by your Ribbon friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <u>Information You Provide to Us Through Your Use of the Service</u>
    </p>
    <p>
      While using the Service, you may provide us with optional information such
      as a phone number or a Ribbon-specific password. We will collect and store
      this information in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While using the Service, you may also provide us with information
      regarding your future plans, which includes places to which you intend to
      travel or events you plan to attend, as well as date ranges and times for
      your travel or event plans. We use this information to provide the core
      service Ribbon offers to its users, namely the ability for a user to plan
      events and travel plans with friends and other Ribbon users. In addition,
      we plan to share information regarding your travel and event plans (cities
      to which you plan to travel and events you plan to attend, as well as date
      ranges for both) with certain third parties, including Third Party
      Businesses and Brands. Please see the paragraphs entitled "Third Party
      Businesses" and "Brands" under Section 7 of this Privacy Policy for more
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also will store information we collect from you regarding locations
      visited and events attended, or locations, events, musical artists, sports
      teams or any other items that you indicate to us through your use of the
      Service that you like through a "like button" or something similar, and we
      may use this information to provide certain third parties, including Third
      Party Businesses, Brands and Ribbon Partners, aggregated information that
      is useful to them. For example, we may provide the operator of a music
      festival with the number of out of town users attending a specific event.
      Please see the paragraph entitled "Brands and Ribbon Partners" in Section
      7 below for more information regarding our sharing of aggregated
      information with third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.
      <u
        >Information We Automatically Collect From You Through Your Use of the
        Service</u
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We will automatically collect and store your current location information
      via GPS or other location tracking on your mobile device should you decide
      to activate this feature. Ribbon current location sharing can be managed
      in your mobile device's location services settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for the collection of your current location as described above and
      the information we collect through the use of cookies as described below
      in Section 5, we do not currently automatically collect or store any
      information about you or your use of the Service. In future versions of
      the Service, we may collect other information about you or your use of the
      Service and we will notify you of any such change in advance by updating
      this Privacy Policy accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>5. <u>Our Use of Cookies or Similar Technology</u></p>
    <p>
      We will use "cookies" (small text files that are stored by your web
      browser) or similar technology in connection with your use of the Service.
      We will use these mainly for authentication and content customization
      purposes. We will also employ third parties, including but not limited to
      Google Analytics, Flurry, KISSmetrics and Mixpanel, who will use cookies
      or similar technology to transmit information about you and your use of
      the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, data relating
      to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked
      on, and the date and time of your use. In the future, we may also decide
      to use cookies to tailor advertising to you so that we deliver you the
      most relevant content. This information helps us understand how our users
      use the Service and how we can improve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may engage third parties for a variety of purposes relating to the
      Service, including to tailor advertising to you so that we deliver you the
      most relevant content. Please note that these third parties may use
      cookies and we do not necessarily have access to or control over the
      cookies they use.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can modify your browser settings to control the collection of cookies.
      If you reject cookies, you may still use the Service, however this may
      impair the functionality of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.
      <u
        >Public Availability of Your Information and Availability on the Ribbon
        Network General Information</u
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon creation of a Ribbon account, certain information will automatically
      be publicly available (i.e., available to everyone), including your name,
      profile pictures and home city. Your Ribbon friends will be able to view
      the number of plans you’ve created, as well as the number of Ribbon
      friends you have and the number of shared plans you have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain basic profile information can be edited by you by visiting Account
      settings or Profile. The public will never be able to see your email
      address or phone number (if you provide).
    </p>
    <p>
      Events. Ribbon includes the ability to search, find and discover events.
      Initially with Ribbon, when you indicate that you are going or maybe going
      to an event, all Ribbon users will be able to see your RSVP status, as
      well as any comments you make in Ribbon regarding the event. In a future
      version of Ribbon, you will have the ability to change visibility and
      privacy settings within the Service to events you create, such that you
      will be able to choose whether your events information is viewable to the
      "public" (all Ribbon users), "Friends of Guests" or "Invite Only." Once
      you select the visibility setting for an event, this cannot be changed by
      you or others you’ve invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you select "Friends of Guests" (or join an event or plan with
      visibility or privacy settings set to "Friends of Guests"), all invitees
      and their friends will be able to view event and plan information you
      enter into Ribbon (including, RSVP status, plan information and
      commenting).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you select "Invite Only" (or join an event or plan with visibility or
      privacy settings set to "Invite Only"), only those Ribbon users you’ve
      invited to a public event will have the ability to view your RSVP status,
      plan information and commenting regarding the public event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create Plan. When creating your own plans within the Service through
      Create Plan (as opposed to through Events), the default visibility setting
      is "Friends of Guests." The "Friends of Guests" setting when creating a
      plan functions the same as when creating a plan, going, maybe going or
      joining Events within the Service. You are also able to change the
      visibility setting when using Create Plan to "Public" or "Invite Only."
      The visibility of both of these settings within Create Plan is the same as
      described above for plans made through Events.
    </p>
    <p>7. <u> Our Sharing of Your Information With Third Parties</u></p>
    <p>
      We will only share your information, including Personal Information, with
      third parties as set forth below:
    </p>
    <p>
      Service Providers. We engage or plan to engage certain trusted third
      parties to perform services for us, including, without limitation,
      services relating to hosting and maintenance, customer communications,
      customer relationships, quality assurance testing, payment processing,
      database storage and management and our direct marketing campaigns. We
      will only provide your Personal Information to these third party service
      providers to the extent necessary for them to provide the services to us
      for which they have been engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brands". "Brands" are musical artists, festivals, sports leagues, sports
      teams, business conferences, venues and other event-related entities whose
      event information is displayed within Ribbon. Ribbon will provide private
      dashboards to Brands. Through these dashboards Brands and their affiliates
      will be able to see certain information regarding you and your plans.
      Specifically, we may share your name, profile image, RSVP status regarding
      the Brands’ events to which you are going or maybe going, the date you
      planned to attend the event on Ribbon, the number of days in advance of
      the event you planned to attend the event on Ribbon, social sharing
      relating to the Brands' events to which you are going or maybe going,
      friends you invite to the Brands' events to which you are going or maybe
      going, those friends that joined and your Ribbon score (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brands who are provided the information described above will use the
      information as fan and customer insights in order to help make better
      marketing and advertising decisions relating to their events. These Brands
      may also contact you through Ribbon, either through emails sent to you by
      Ribbon, or by some message or notification to you within the Service, in
      order to communicate with you regarding their brand or other relevant
      information, such as deals or promotions that are being offered to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ribbon also intends to provide Brands and their affiliates aggregated
      information relating to our users and their usage of the Service,
      including, but not limited to, age, gender, home city, number of friends,
      the source of how a user came to use the Service, and application usage
      metrics such as number of plans, invites, suggestions, comments, clicks,
      views, impressions, and adding, joining or social sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Ribbon score is a number assigned to you by Ribbon which reflects how
      active and potentially influential you are on Ribbon. Each time you
      indicate on Ribbon that you are going or maybe going to an event or making
      travel plans, invite a friend to join Ribbon or socially share an event or
      travel plans, you accumulate points. Your Ribbon score may affect the
      quality of the deals or promotions you are offered by Brands and Ribbon
      Partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not provide your email address to any Brands. The only Personal
      Information of yours that we intend to provide any Brands is your name,
      profile picture and birthday. If our intentions change regarding our
      sharing of your information with Brands and Ribbon Partners as set forth
      in the paragraphs above, we will notify you of this change in advance by
      emailing you or by posting a notice on the Service prior to the effective
      date of the changes, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third Party Businesses. Ribbon will enter into business and advertising
      relationships with a variety of companies such as travel services,
      ticketing services and event brands. Some of these companies may seek to
      advertise to sell products or services to you through Ribbon (these
      companies are referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Third Party
      Businesses").
    </p>
    <p>
      Ribbon may also seek to sell you products or services in partnership with
      some Third Party Businesses. The attempted sale of products or services
      may occur by way of emails sent to you by Ribbon, or by some communication
      to you within the Service by Ribbon or the Third Party Businesses. In
      either case, the only information relating to you that Ribbon currently
      intends to share with Third Party Businesses that is not in aggregated
      form is your current location and future location plans (cities to which
      you plan to travel and events you plan to attend, as well as date ranges
      for both). We will not provide your email address to any Third Party
      Businesses. If our intentions change regarding our sharing of your
      information with Third Party Businesses as set forth in this paragraph, we
      will notify you of this change in advance by emailing you or by posting a
      notice on the Service prior to the effective date of the changes, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third Party Applications. We will never share your activity on other third
      party applications, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, without your
      permission. Your sharing of your plan information to third party
      applications is controlled by you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business Transfer. We may share information from or about you with
      subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, in
      which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another
      company acquires Ribbon or all or substantially all of Ribbon’s assets,
      your information would be transferred to that acquiring company, and that
      company would assume the rights and obligations with respect to that
      information as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protection of Ribbon and Others. We may disclose your Personal Information
      to third parties when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is
      necessary to (i) comply with applicable law, orders or other legal process
      served on us, (ii) investigate, identify or prevent possible wrongdoing in
      connection with the Service, (iii) enforce our Terms of Use and other
      agreements, or (iv) protect the rights, property or safety of Ribbon or
      its employees, users or others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Links. The Service may contain links to third party websites. This privacy
      policy is not applicable to any third party website or application outside
      of the Service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these
      third parties and we recommend that you read the privacy policies on all
      such third party websites that you visit. Except as set forth in this
      Privacy Policy, we do not share your Personal Information with these third
      parties.

      information and announcements about the product, key features, upcoming
      feature releases, and other relevant information.

      Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive
      it. No method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or
